# GROMACS_desolvation_crowding
**GROMACS input files for PGK simulations at high pressure and crowding.**
**Used in: AG Gasic et al. "Critical Phenomena in the Temperature-pressure-crowding Phase Diagram of a Protein." (2019) Nature Physics.** 

The Cheung group (https://sites.google.com/nsm.uh.edu/cheung/) from University of Houston conducts research using molecular simulations of coarse-grained protein models. We are releasing these input files for GROMACS 2016.3 to promote research in protein folding and dynamics under high pressure and/or crowded conditions. 

These input files includes additional Hamiltonian terms using by a tabulated potential for the coarse-grained deslovation model with and without crowders.
